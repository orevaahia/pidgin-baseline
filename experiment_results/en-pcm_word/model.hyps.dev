For this kind character , some people no need to wear beard beard beard beard beard , and dem no need to wear am .
E fit no easy for you to do things wey you fit do to do for Jehovah work .

E good make we dey show sey we get faith for God Kingdom ?
Paul tell the brothers for Rome .
But e no easy for us to help us .
Wetin we go talk about for Romans chapter 8 ?

For some place , some people wey dey there no know where dem suppose do reach , even if dem want choose wetin dem want .
Even though sey this kind thing dey happen , e dey make mistake .
But e no good make we no dey carry body down when person die for mind ?

For the first vision , the first thing wey God get for mind na ‘ person wey dey sleep ’ and wey dey do bad thing .
For example , dem send me go Ghana go Ghana go preach for one place wey dem dey use one language wey dem dey do .

Make we dey sure of the advice wey dey Psalm 119 .
E no easy for us to comot hand from the bad things wey we get for mind . But we no need to get am for mind sey we no go fit comot hand from the bad thing wey we dey do .

For example , the first time wey dem take dey do wetin Jehovah want , and e dey try to do wetin Jehovah want .
The work wey we fit do to make sure sey Jehovah Witness people dey do before that time .

When Hezekiah die , e come dey sick . Even though sey e don marry , e get one mind sey e go use im life do wetin e talk .
After that time , the things wey dem dey do for this world no be like that .
The first thing be sey , e no easy for person to do bad things .
The question wey dem tell dem sey : “ Wetin we go learn from Memorial ?
For example , many people wey dey serve Jehovah fit help dem .
( Go check the box “ Wickedness ” wey dey inside . )
Na true sey we fit learn from Bible .
But e no easy for person to control imself .

Instead , e no easy for David to do wetin e talk , but e no want make e no do wetin e talk .
E good make we no do anything wey go make us no fear , and make we no stop to forgive dem .
